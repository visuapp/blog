You can get closer to your dreams if you visualize on a daily basis. In VISUAPP you can establish any day, time and duration. Let's see how to do it.

*Click on the clock icon to open alarms screen:*

*Set alarm time:*

*Set alarm days:*

*Set alarm duration:*

*And finally switch the new alarm on:*

And with this you have just created a reminder that will pop up at the time you need remembering you to visualize a dream.
