You can get closer to your dreams if you visualize on a daily basis. In VISUAPP you can establish any day, time and duration. Let's see how to do it.

*Go to Settings -> Notifications *

*Set alarm days, duration of visualization, save the alarm and switch it on*

*Swipe right or left to remove the notifications*

And with this you have just created a reminder that will pop up at the time you need remembering you to visualize a dream.
