## What is it Feng Shui vision board?

Feng-Shui vision board is a new functionality of VISUAPP that allows you to categorize your dreams and create Feng-Shui 9-section vision board. This board allows you to filter your dreams by category and form a square of 9 most important dreams that you have. Each of 9 photos represents 9 most important aspects of our life: **money, fame, relationship, family, health, creativity, knowledge, career and travel**. Just decide which photo should form a part of your square. 

**Congratulations, from today you have 9 more vision boards that allows you to concentrate in one particular area of your life!!!**

## A little bit of history

Feng Shui vision board takes the root from the antique Bagua map that was invented around 2500 years ago and even Confucius was involved on it creation. 

In Chinese “Ba-Gua” means “eight-sided”, showing that the map has eight sides representing the most important areas of our life that we have already mentioned above. The center of the map represents your health, physical and emotional state.
